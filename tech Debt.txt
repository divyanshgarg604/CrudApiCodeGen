1.MULTIPLE JSON:-
	For the Generation of the Service and Controller layer files we are using the json file to fill the templates
	and as of now we are creating the multiple json from the pojos class so the total number of json file is equal
	to the number of pojos classes.

	Solution:
		we have to reduce the json file to one so we can use the only one json to fill the multiple templates or we should use YAML.

2.Patch Operations:-
	Our current version is not supported the patch operation we only go with the put. when we are using the patch it is updating the
	changed fields and the unchanged fields become the null. 
	(for ex: If we have one Student table and fields are SName,Rollno,id, address and we want to perform the update operation 
	and want  to  update the only rollno and addresss in this case when we update only with two fields the rest of the fields become null) 

	Solution:
		
3. Our current version is not supporting the batch operations means batch insertion or deletion.

4. Dialect should be configurable
